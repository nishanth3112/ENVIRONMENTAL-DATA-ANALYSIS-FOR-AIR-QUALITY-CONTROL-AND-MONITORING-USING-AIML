cyclone the system was first noted as a depression on  may  while it was located over the bay of bengal about  km  mi to the southeast of chennai india during the next day the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm and started to intensify rapidly becoming a super cyclonic storm early on  may the cyclone weakened slightly before it made landfall on india about  km  mi to the north of madras in the andhra pradesh state as a very severe cyclonic storm with winds of  kmh  mph while over land the cyclone gradually dissipated the cyclone had a severe impact on india with over  people reported to have been killed over  animals also died in the cyclone with the total cost of damages to crops estimated at over  million  usdon  may  the india meteorological department imd reported that a depression had developed over the bay of bengal about  km  mi to the southeast of chennai india during that day the system gradually developed further and became the subject of a tropical cyclone formation alert by the joint typhoon warning center as it moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure the depression subsequently intensified into a cyclonic storm early the next day before the jtwc initiated advisories on the system and designated it as tropical cyclone  later that day at this stage the jtwc only expected the cyclone to intensify marginally before it weakened as it made landfall in southern india within  hours during  may the system started to move more towards the northwest because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge as it continued to intensify and became a very severe cyclonic storm this turn towards the northwest turned out to be more northerly than had been expected which as a result allowed the system to stay offshore for longer than had been expected by the jtwcover the next couple of days the system rapidly intensified before the jtwc reported early on  may that the system had peaked with  sustained windspeeds of  kmh  mph which made the system equivalent to a category  hurricane on the saffir–simpson hurricane wind scale at around the same time the imd also reported that the cyclone had peaked as a super cyclonic storm with  sustained wind speeds of  kmh  mph and an estimated central pressure of  hpa  inhg by this time the system was located about  km  mi to the northeast of madras and was moving northwards slowly later that day as the ship visvamohini moved through the systems eye region it measured a central pressure of  hpa  inhg which the imd reported would be one of the lowest central pressures ever measured in the bay of bengal if it was correct the system subsequently started to weaken and had become a very severe cyclonic storm by the time it made landfall during  may near the mouth of the krishna river in southern andhra pradesh the system subsequently moved northwestwards and gradually weakened further before it was last noted during  may by both the imd and jtwcas a result of timely warnings issued by the imd the indian government was able to launch an evacuation campaign and order that all fisherman return to shore this led to more than  people being evacuated to relief camps which had been set up on higher ground due to the thorough preparations there was fewer deaths than in the  andhra pradesh cycloneon edurumondi island over  people were left stranded after they refused to evacuate the island itself was reported to have experienced the full brunt of the system however all of the residents reportedly sought protection within a shelter provided by the government the cyclone had a significant effect on india with storm surge tides as high as  meters  ft above normal consequently over  villages were submerged in water and destroyed at least  people were killed by the cyclone most of the deaths occurred when houses made mostly out of mud and straw collapsed other people were killed when electrical wires were knocked down and while some people were carried away by flooded rivers the storm left at least  million people homeless while over  farm animals were killed at least  acres   of rice paddies were destroyed along with huge tracts of mango and banana trees the total damage to crops and property was estimated at over  million  usd the cyclone was described as the worst disaster in southern india since the  storm sea water contaminated fresh drinking wells prompting warnings about outbreaks of cholera and typhoid as many people were drinking and cooking with water from the drains which was causing stomach disordersoverall the cyclone only caused minor damage to tamil nadu with the worst affected area being the district of chengalpattu where one of the old shrines of kasiviswanathar temple collapsed as high waves hit the coast a large number of huts were also washed away by the waves while six deaths were reported in the stateon  may two days after the cyclone had hit the indian government launched a massive relief and rescue operation the indian army and naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone and also dropped food packets although the indian government did not request international assistance the red cross provided food oil medicines and water tanks for the affected families the wcccicarws issued an appeal for   usd so they could provide immediate needs with world

vtepn crashed onto a golf course while attempting to land at bangalore killing  of  people on boardthe indian investigative team ruled that the probable cause was the pilots selecting the open descentflight idle control mode rather than glideslope capture allowing the aircraft to sink far below the correct flight path they further failed to advance the throttles or pull up even after the radio altitude callouts as the aircraft approached landing the report stated that the crew of flight  weren’t aware of the situation and the danger they were facing at the time resulting in delayed reaction during the descentafter the crash the indian investigation committee issued  recommendations to the indian directorate general of civil aviation dgca including a time recording on the air traffic control atc tapes and the formation of several investigative committees specializing in several aviation operational issues included in the recommendation was the addition of a crash siren in bangalore evaluation of the evacuation doors and slides in airbus airplanes and a design change on their instrument knob the report also urged the government to evaluate every airport in india to prevent similar incidents from occurringthe crash drew criticism among the indian commercial pilot association icpa which claimed that the airbus  had severe flaws they claimed that the aircrafts systems were too confusing and that the crew of flight  was struggling to avert the crashanother  accident less than two years later which occurred under similar circumstances led to design improvements to the flight control unit and numerous safety recommendationsflight  took off from bombay airport at  local time after an hour delay prior to this the aircraft was used for two other flights on the day of the accident operating as flight  and flight  flying from bombay to goa and back the aircraft was an airbus  registered in india as vtepn first delivered to indian airlines on  december  carrying  passengers and  crew members including  infants the aircrafts assigned route was on route  from bombay to belgaum via karad and  from belgaum to bangalore the takeoff phase and en route phase proceeded normallyat  local time flight  radar plot appeared on bangalores radar flight  was asked by bangalore radar to turn right and make a visual approach to runway  the crew disengaged the autopilot and later changed to the bangalore tower after being transferred by bangalore radarwhile flight  was attempting to land the pilots flew far below the glideslope and the landing gear touched down on the grounds of the karnataka golf club approximately  ft from the airport most people on the aircraft including some crew members thought that the aircraft had touched down on the runway as it was similar to its normal landing flight  then bounced and shortly later impacted the ground for the second time the impact caused several peoples seat belts to fail leading people to be thrown from their seats and hit the aircrafts floor flight  later struck a  embankment both the engines and landing gear detached from the aircraft the aircraft then flew over a road and crashed into a grassy rocky area near the airportafter the crash a postimpact fire started and the survivors began to escape from the burning wreckage several people managed to get out of the plane from an opening in the aircrafts fuselage the surviving cabin crew opened the emergency door on the airplane and began to evacuate the survivors   people consisting of  passengers and  crew perished in the crash while  survived all with injuries two people succumbed to their injuries after the accidentaccording to eyewitnesses no fire service units reached the crash site as there was no radio transmitter rt communication facility between the tower and firefighting vehicles a portable radio transmitter was available for communication between the tower and the aerodrome fire station but was not serviceable on the day of the accidentflight  carried  passengers and  crew members consisting of  cockpit crew and  cabin crew there were  infants aboard the flightthe pilot who controlled the flight was indian national captain cyril fernandez at  years old he joined indian airlines in  as a pilot and was promoted to the position of copilot eventually he became captain of a hawker siddeley hs  in  fernandez obtained a boeing  copilot rating followed by a captain rating in  fernandez became the copilot of an airbus  in  fernandez had a total flying experience of  hours of which  hours were spent on the airbus  to the report captain fernandez was under supervision as he was undergoing the first of  route checks required for qualification to captain during the flight he was seated in the left seatthe pilot who supervised captain fernandez was indian national captain satish gopujkar at  years old he joined indian airlines in  and was employed as a copilot on a hawker siddeley hs  from – later flying the plane as a captain in  he obtained a boeing  copilot rating and later a pilot in command rating in  in  he was promoted as a copilot on an airbus  captain gopujkar had a total flying experience of  hours of which  hours were on the airbus  during the flight he was carrying out the duties of both the copilot and the check pilotbefore flight  captain gopujkar was involved in a taxiing incident in cochin although he was not blamed for the incident during flight  he was seated in the right  people were killed in the crash including captain gopujkar and captain fernandez according to official reports amongst the  injured people at least  had suffered head injuries  suffered lower limb injuries while  sustained thoracic injuries details in the report revealed that most of the dead suffered major trauma during the crash at least  victims were revealed to have suffered shock and burn injuriesthe report then stated that several passengers may have been too injured to move leaving them physically unable to escape from the burning wreckage they may have survived the impact but due to the injuries they suffered during the crash they couldnt escape the report stated that most people seated near the emergency exits and slides survived the crashas most survivors and victims of the crash suffered head and leg injuries the investigative team stated that those injuries might have occurred to the passengers and some of the crew onboard as a result of the inadequate leg room in addition during the crash several seats were thrust forward causing several passengers head to slam into the back of the seat in front of themthe indian ministry of civil aviation ordered a fullscale investigation into the crash the indian aaib and the canadian tsb were involved in the investigation on  february investigators visited the crash site and inspected the wreckage of the aircraft they noted that the front part of the aircraft was destroyed during its impact with the embankment a subsequent fire led to the total destruction of the aircraftinvestigators then inspected the flight controls of flight  viz the rudder the ailerons the trimmable horizontal stabilizer the flaps and slats and several other flight controls however they didnt find any abnormalities on these controls control failure was ruled out as a possible cause of the crash according to investigators they also ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash as there were no signs of an onboard explosion during the approach and there was no evidence of explosives on boardafter the discovery of the fdr and the cvr investigators decoded and analyzed its contentsinvestigators made an analysis based on both flight recorders as followsflight  was approaching bangalore airport in open descent mode in this mode the aircraft engines are at the idle throttle people would notice this since the engines seem to turn silent and the plane appears to be sinking graduallythe crew of flight  disengaged the autopilot when sighting the runway of bangalore airport they later made contact with bangalore tower at  pm local time the aircraft display indicated that the plane’s altitude had been just under  feet and its approach path was  ft higher than the normal glide pathcaptain fernandez noticed this and requested for a goaround he would climb to  ft do another circle and come back better aligned to the normal glide path the check pilot captain gopujkar then responded to his request do you want a go around or do you want vertical speed captain fernandez chose to proceed with the vertical speed option if the pilots had proceeded with the goaround the emergency that was to follow could have been avertedsince the plane was a little higher than the normal glide path captain fernandez asked for a higher descent rate of  ftmin instead of the normal rate of  ftmin this faster descent increased the aircraft speed to  kmhr — higher than the recommended speed of  kmhr — but it helped the aircraft regain the normal glide path the aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode — the correct mode for landingcaptain gopujkar then checked the landing checklist after completing the checklist he asked the cabin crew to be seated at their stations realizing that the aircraft had regained its normal glide path captain gopujkar reported at  that he had now selected a  ft rate of descent however instead of choosing the vertical speed knob he accidentally chose the altitude knob so instead of inputting an order for a  ft rate of descent to the airbus  he made an order to put the aircraft on an altitude of  ftthe vertical speed knob and the altitude knob are located next to each other and have a similar design this might have led to the confusionbecause of captain gopujkars action the aircraft went back to the open descent mode causing the throttle to be in the idle position the absence of engine power on the aircraft led to a decrease of the aircrafts speed and the plane began descending more quickly despite the impending disaster the crew of flight  seemed to be unaware of itthe planes radio altimeter then sounded  ft this probably alerted captain gopujkar in some way because he suddenly observed you are descending on idle open descend eh all this time and as the altimeter called out  ft captain gopujkar asked you want flight directors off now captain fernandez confirmed that his flight director had been put off captain gopujkars however hadnt if both the flight directors had been put off at that point the plane would have gone to the speed mode sensing that speed was dropping and enough engine power could have been generated for a possible recovery even at that late stagethe plane continued to hurtle downwards when the plane was only  ft from the ground captain fernandez suddenly realized the gravity of the situation and exclaimed hey were going down captain gopujkar himself stunned now could only respond with oh shit those were his last recorded words captain fernandez then ordered an immediate toga takeoff goaround however this action was too late the aircraft did lift from the ground however it failed to clear a  embankment and crashed investigators stated that if this action had been taken  seconds earlier the disaster could have been avertedthe high court of karnataka reported that the accident was caused by the pilots failing to realize the gravity of the situation and failing to respond by immediately advancing the throttles even after the radio altitude callouts of four hundred three hundred and two hundred feet despite knowing that the plane was in idleopen descent modeindias investigative team concluded that pilot error was the cause of the accident which was supported by airbus industrie however the india commercial pilot association icpa disputed the report claiming that a design flaw on the airbus  was the cause of the crashthe icpa stated that the senior captain of the flight captain gopujkar wouldnt have made the series of mistakes and stated that there was no proof that he made the faulty setting since the flight data recorder didnt record such mistakes the association also believes that the engines went into idle power because of a major system defect even when gopujkar tried to shut his director off it didnt respond they also claimed that the time lag of  seconds for the autothrust controls to act proved to be disastrousat the time the airbus  was relatively new having just been launched in  its main difference from other aircraft was that it used flybywire fbw technology in a conventional aircraft the pilot was in direct contact with the actuator so if the pilot opened the throttle more the actuator immediately gave the pilot more power in the  however the pilot’s command is first directed to an onboard computer — and the actuator responds only when the computer determines that it is okay to do sobefore the crash of flight  an airbus  had been involved in another crash air france flight  official investigations determined that the cause of the crash was pilot error however the pilot blamed the planes flybywire system for the crash this claim caused a major controversy about the airbus  than two years after the crash of flight  the  suffered another fatal accident when air inter flight  crashed in france killing  people the cause was also a cfit like  the investigation of flight  harshly criticized the airbus  cockpit design in response changes were made to the flight control unit panel display the french aviation safety authority issued  recommendations</td>\n",
